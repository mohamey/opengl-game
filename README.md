# Open Gl Game Project
A game developed using OpenGL that only runs on windows and, fair warning, is kinda aight.

## Requirements
Haven't really tested it, so hardware requirements are kinda hit or miss. Just cross your fingers.

Currently the game only works on Windows

## Play the Game
You are trapped in a city where a robot banana army is invading. You have infinite monkeys at your disposal and you are the last person left in the city. Blast the incoming banana hordes with your monkey cannons. Try to survive as long as possible.

To play the game you need to go to `Code/Release`, then double click `Lab 5.exe` and it _should_ run.

## Controls
* WASD to move
* Mouse/trackpad to look around
* Left mouse button to shoot primary gun
* Right mouse button to shoot bazooka (once every 3 seconds)
* `x` button to exit

__You have to exit the game and doubleclick lab 5.exe everytime you want to restart__
